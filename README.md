##DESCRIPTION* : Task 3 involves the design and simulation of a basic 4-stage pipelined processor using Verilog HDL to demonstrate the fundamental concept of instruction pipelining in digital systems. The processor is organized into four sequential stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), and Write Back (WB), with pipeline registers used between stages to allow multiple instructions to be processed concurrently. A simple instruction format is used to support basic operations such as ADD, SUB, and LOAD, operating on a small register file and data memory for clarity. On each clock cycle, instructions advance through the pipeline stages, and the corresponding operations are performed based on the opcode. A Verilog testbench is created to generate the clock and observe internal signals, enabling verification of correct pipeline behavior. The design is simulated using EDA Playground with the Icarus Verilog simulator, and waveform analysis is carried out using EPWave to clearly show instruction flow across all four stages. The successful simulation confirms proper pipelined execution and register updates, and all design files, testbench code, and simulation results are uploaded to a GitHub repository as part of the task submission.
